# MinimalistVC - Modern and Clean Personal Template

This is just a draft of a Modern and Clean Personal Template.
Please, fell free to download and make the changes you wish.

#A) Project Structure 

This theme is composed by several divisors components, and a menu. Each divisor corresponds to a different menu item. The code is fully commented, helping the user to customize it.

The theme offers you 7 different colors to customize your template. Those colors can be black, green, blue, red, pink, gold or purple.

To change the template color by other in the pallet, you need just to edit the first line of your 'card.js' file, overwriting "green"by the desired color.

#B) CSS

I'm using one CSS file in this theme. This file contains some general styling, such as font-sizes, background colors, etc.

#C) JavaScript

This theme imports five Javascript files.

jQuery 1.10.2 and 2.0.3
Card.js
Lightbox Plugin
jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.
This script contains the main functions to make the template works correctly. All of its functions are well commented and organized.
